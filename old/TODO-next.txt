-clean up last major block of code in data-prep.ipynb (it works as expected now, but can be translated to series, which makes more sense and will run quicker)

-write bracket figure generator

-start data analysis and model building. how will the training and testing data be broken up? (1 year test, several years test, etc.)

-update bracket-scraper to handle current year data (I don't know what the format will look like, will need to be done in March. Bracket can be manually entered if time crunched)

-update stat prep to handle current year data
